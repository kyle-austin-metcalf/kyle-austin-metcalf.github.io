# Welcome to my website.

## My name is Kyle Metcalf. I have my BA in Psychology and I am currently studyng programming.

## Here are a few things I am interested in:
 Building an application to help organize out political system? 
 I think it would be interesting to build a card with stats for each politician.
 
## I am also very interested in robotics. I think they could become a great help to people who
  cannot take care of themselves. I thnk people should stil have human interection but people who
  arent able to care for themselves and are older shouldnt have to only depend on their family
  alone. Having 24 hour care can cose about $150,000 a year. 

## I would also like to build a website that allows people to understand themselves more. 
  I like certain personality assesments based on the big five. What insights could these tests
  offer?
