# Welcome to my website.

# My name is Kyle Metcalf and I hold a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. I am currently studying programming and am passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems and improve people's lives.

## One area of interest for me is building applications to help improve the efficiency and transparency of our political system. I am considering developing a tool that displays key information and statistics about politicians in an easily digestible format.
 
## I am also deeply interested in robotics and their potential to assist individuals who are unable to care for themselves. While I believe it is important for humans to have interpersonal interactions, I believe that robotics can play a role in providing round-the-clock care for those in need at a lower cost than traditional options such as hiring a full-time caregiver. 

## Finally, I am considering creating a website that helps individuals better understand themselves through personality assessments based on the "Big Five" personality  traits. I believe that such tests can offer valuable insights into one's own strengths and weaknesses and help individuals make informed decisions about their personal and professional lives.
